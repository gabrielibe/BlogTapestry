# blog_tapestry

Blog Tapestry is a Flutter-based personal project I designed to gather blog content from different sources all in one place. I used this project to solidify my understanding and use of state management (Flutter Riverpod), particularly in the context of collecting and displaying data from various APIs. With this project, I also learned about data caching and enabling offline data support using the Hive package. It's not just about the tech side but making sure users have a great experience while using the app.
